### Current Research Topics

<h4>3D Electron Diffraction</h4>
<p>Currently I am working in the electron microscopy group under the supervision of Professor Paul Midgley. We are investigating machine learning approaches to enhance the analysis of transmission electron diffraction images.</p>

### Previous Research Topics

#### Design of a Novel Ultrafast Electron Microscope

<p>
  During my time working in McGill Universityâ€™s
  <a href="https://quantumdynamics.lab.mcgill.ca/" target="_blank" class="text-blue-600 underline">Quantum Dynamics Lab (QDL)</a>,
  I was involved in the design of a novel point-projection microscope, to be built by January 2025. The system aims to achieve
  single-shot imaging with femtosecond (fs) resolution, using coupled THz pulses to drive electron emission from tungsten
  nanotips. The primary objective of this project was to achieve the beam brightness and coherence required to achieve
  nm-resolution holographic imaging capabilities.

#### Optimizing Plasma-Based THz Sources for Electron Emission

<p>
  One key project investigated during my MSc was the generation and optimization of THz pulses using plasma-based sources, where
  we discovered a novel spatiotemporal spreading effect when focusing THz light. This finding led to insights into enhancing
  THz pulse delivery and control, which are crucial for nonlinear spectroscopy applications.
