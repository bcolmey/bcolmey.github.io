### About me
I am a PhD candidate in materials physics at the University of Cambridge, specializing in electron microscopy and machine learning techniques for materials characterization. My research focuses on applying innovative computational approaches to the treatment of microscopy data with the aim of opening the technique to previously unobserved materials.
<br><br>
Before coming to Cambridge, I spent the past seven years in Montreal, Canada, where I recently completed my MSc degree in condensed matter physics at McGill University. At other times I have lived in several cities, including Hong Kong, Jakarta, Paris, and Tel Aviv.
<br><br>
Outside of my academic pursuits, I enjoy traveling and have visited over 30 countries. My hobbies include cooking and woodworking, where I find joy in creating something from scratch and working with my hands. I also maintain an active lifestyle through triathlons and hiking, which provide a balance between physical challenge and time in nature. My intellectual pursuits include creative writing, literature, cinema, and history, which continually broaden my perspective and fuel my love for storytelling. I am always open to new experiences and enjoy learning new things.
