# About me
I am a PhD candidate in materials physics at the University of Cambridge, specializing in electron microscopy and machine learning techniques for materials characterization. My research focuses on applying innovative computational approaches to the treatment of microscopy data with the aim of opening the technique to previously unobserved materials.
<br><br>
Before coming to Cambridge, I spent the past seven years in Montreal, Canada, where I recently completed my MSc degree in condensed matter physics at McGill University. At other times I have lived in several cities, including Hong Kong, Jakarta, Paris, and Tel Aviv.
<br><br> Outside of my academic pursuits, I am actively involved in teaching and volunteering. As a teaching assistant, I enjoy helping students grasp complex concepts more intuitively, fostering a deeper curiosity and understanding. In my volunteer work with the autistic community, I'm committed to creating spaces where everyone feels visible and heard. I am continually learning from these interactions, gaining new perspectives on communication, empathy, and the unique ways we all experience the world.
<br><br> I also enjoy traveling, having visited over 30 countries, and engage in hobbies like cooking and woodworking.
